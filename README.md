# Trustpilotscraper-Transformer
-> My First Github upload

This is a functional webscraper for ANY Trustpilot.com pages. The Python script allows you to convert some lines that are in the wrong format, such as the date, which is a str and therefore not well usable for data science. There are already some working lines in the Python script. I developed this script for my master thesis. Therefore I have a detailed description in it. Below you can find an abstract for my master thesis.
